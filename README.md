# Reinforcement-Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Each day represents a new thing I learnt. But, so mostly this is going to be simple explainations for RL. I'm following the Explain Like I'm Five (ELI5) method. So, that later on I have an easier time going around the various topics during my phase.
